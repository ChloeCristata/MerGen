ClanGen MerCat Sprites AKA MerGen
(Mod by Cristata)
________________________________________
MerCats are an odd species: 
feline yet aquatic, with fins, gills, and tails that aren’t those of a fish, a shark, or a dolphin, but rather something in between. 
They have fur like their land-dwelling counterparts—except theirs is adapted to their environment, 
being largely water-resistant and thinning out along the tail.

Additional credit to:
MilqStar and their own Sharkits which inspired this mod!
SharkSpirit for the adorable guppy pelt that they made!
And FloralFever for letting me use and tweak their bandanas!

INSTALLATION:
Step One: Download MerGen! ...If you're reading this, then you already did that. Good job!
Step Two: Go through the exact same process as you would for setting up the development version of the normal unmodded game 
(aka install Thonny and the required packages, all that jazz). If you don't know how to do that, check the #faq in the ClanGen server.
Step Three: Run the main script (main.py) found in your MerGen folder using Thonny.
Step Four: ???
Step Five: PROFIT

Feel free to modify these sprites however you want (within reason)! 
Just make sure to give me credit for the originals. I’d love to see what people come up with!
And if anyone wants to make stories or videos featuring my mod at all, one, I'd be flattered, two, PLEASE SHARE????
